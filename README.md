# Oracle Cloud Comparison Matrix

- This chart lets you compare Oracle Cloud Services with other Cloud Platform companies as well as niche players and open source solutions. 
- Check out the official Oracle Cloud Icons [here](https://github.com/danielehrlich/Oracle-Cloud-Official-Icons). You won't find everything below available there, but it's a very good start.
- Special thanks to Joshua Levy, the original creator of the AWS Open Guide, on which this table is based (disclosure - I am also a contributor to that repo).
- I am an employee of Oracle Corporation, but nonetheless, views below are my own and based on personal and professional experience.

##Editing 

- Feel free to send in a pull request. 
- *Note: the easiest way to edit this document is to use Sublime Text. Open the file , and then go to `View>>>Word Wrap`. If "Word Wrap" is turned off, you'll see the table appear clearly and it will be easy to edit. Otherwise, it will be a jumble of pipes and dashes and words.*
